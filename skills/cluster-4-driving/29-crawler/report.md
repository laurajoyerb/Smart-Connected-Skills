#  Crawler

Author: Laura Joy Erb, 2019-11-05

## Summary
In this skill, we ran the crawler through calibration in two different modes. We ran the crawler using the remote control (ie, Race Day), and then we disconnected the remote control and used the ESP32 to control the crawler.

We wired up the ESP32 to the ESC steering control on the crawler as a servo. We used the calibrate function to cycle the crawler through steering center, full left, full right, and back to center. 

## Sketches and Photos
Here is the video of the crawler in action as controlled by the ESP:
